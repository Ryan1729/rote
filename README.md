# rote - Ryan's Own Text Editor

# JUST BARELY FUNCTIONAL (... as of yet?)

This is a text editor, designed for my own use. It's at the point that I can and do use it to edit its own source code, but there's loads more to do yet.

([The link in the pic so you don't need to type it](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/weird-exprs.rs))

## Plan
* implement everything in [TODO.md](./design/TODO.md) and [MVP-FEATURES.md](./design/MVP-FEATURES.md).
* Think of more useful features?
