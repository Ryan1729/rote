# rote - Ryan's Own Text Editor

# NOT EVEN CLOSE TO FUNCTIONAL (... yet?)

I'm starting this project over, this time as a graphical editor from the start instead of a terminal based one.

![demo gif](/rote-0.2.10.gif?raw=true "Demo gif of a text editor performing a simple editing task")

## Plan
* implement everything in [MVP-FEATURES.md](./design/MVP-FEATURES.md).
* Think of more useful features and/or add support for external code scanning programs like [`rls`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls)
