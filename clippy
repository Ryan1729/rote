# enum-glob-use used tastefully, inside small scopes doesn't cause a problem, 
#    besides sometimes needing to disambiguate.
# default-trait-access enables the wonderfully terse `d` macro. I think the amount
#    of places that macros is used is the best argument for saving those characters.
# wildcard-imports can be used carefully to prevent them from making it hard to find
#    where things are imported from, if when creating them we ensure that in each 
#    module there is at most one module import that uses them. It would be nice to
#    have a lint for that though.
