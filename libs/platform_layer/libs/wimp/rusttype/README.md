# Modification Note

This copy of [RustType](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/rusttype) has been modified to suit the needs of rote. In particular the initial copy was made from commit [383861acd168c6c8dd77340591f49dd239e83074](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/rusttype/commit/383861acd168c6c8dd77340591f49dd239e83074).

RustType is a pure Rust alternative to libraries like FreeType.

The current capabilities of RustType:

* Reading TrueType formatted fonts and font collections. This includes `*.ttf`
  as well as a subset of `*.otf` font files.
* Retrieving glyph shapes and commonly used properties for a font and its glyphs.
* Laying out glyphs horizontally using horizontal and vertical metrics, and
  glyph-pair-specific kerning.
* Rasterising glyphs with sub-pixel positioning using an accurate analytical
  algorithm (not based on sampling).
* Managing a font cache on the GPU with the `gpu_cache` module. This keeps
  recently used glyph renderings
  in a dynamic cache in GPU memory to minimise texture uploads per-frame. It
  also allows you keep the draw call count for text very low, as all glyphs are
  kept in one GPU texture.

Notable things that RustType does not support *yet*:

* OpenType formatted fonts that are not just TrueType fonts (OpenType is a
  superset of TrueType). Notably there is no support yet for cubic Bezier curves
  used in glyphs.
* Font hinting.
* Ligatures of any kind
* Some less common TrueType sub-formats.
* Right-to-left and vertical text layout.

## Getting Started

To hit the ground running with RustType, look at the `simple.rs` example
supplied with the crate. It demonstrates loading a font file, rasterising an
arbitrary string, and displaying the result as ASCII art. If you prefer to just
look at the documentation, the entry point for loading fonts is
`FontCollection`, from which you can access individual fonts, then their glyphs.

## Future Plans

The initial motivation for the project was to provide easy-to-use font rendering for games.
There are numerous avenues for improving RustType. Ideas:

* Some form of hinting for improved legibility at small font sizes.
* Replacing the dependency on
  [stb_truetype-rs](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/stb_truetype-rs)
  (a translation of [stb_truetype.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_truetype.h)),
  with OpenType font loading written in idiomatic Rust.
* Add support for cubic curves in OpenType fonts.
* Extract the rasterisation code into a separate vector graphics rendering crate.
* Support for some common forms of ligatures.
* And, eventually, support for embedded right-to-left Unicode text.

If you think you could help with achieving any of these goals, feel free to open
a tracking issue for discussing them.
