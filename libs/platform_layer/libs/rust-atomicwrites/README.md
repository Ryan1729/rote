# Edit explanation

This vendored copy of `rust-atomicwrites` exists to update to a new version of `tempfile` to address a security concern about a possible TOCTOU error in the newest version of `rust-atomicwrites` at the time of the vendoring.

Atomic file-writes. Works on both POSIX and Windows.

The basic idea is to write to temporary files (in the same file
system), and move them when done writing.
This avoids the problem of two programs writing to the same file. For
`AllowOverwrite`, `rename` is used. For `DisallowOverwrite`, `link + unlink` is
used instead to raise errors when the target path already exists.

This is mostly a port of the same-named [Python package](https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites).

## Example

```rust
use atomicwrites::{AtomicFile,DisallowOverwrite};

let af = AtomicFile::new("foo", DisallowOverwrite);
af.write(|f| {
    f.write_all(b"HELLO")
})?;
```

## Alternatives

- [tempfile](https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile) has a `persist` method doing the same thing.
